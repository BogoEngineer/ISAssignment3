## Linear Regression
Multivariable linear regression algorithm applied to a houseprices dataset. The goal was to predict a house price by looking at some input features, such as: area, year_build and number of bathrooms.
Algorithm is realized both manualy and using pre-made model (sklearn linear regression model). 
Prediction scores of both algorithms are evaluated after training (R^2 scores are matching and the value is 0.68). 
Before training, input data has been plotted, normalized (for a better GD performance) and divided into training and test sets.

## Decision Tree Classification
Multivariable decision tree classification algorithm applied to a cake dataset. The goal was to classify a cake (muffin or cupcake) by looking at some of input features, such as: flour, eggs, sugar, milk, butter, baking_powder.
Algorithm is realized using pre-made model(sklearn decision tree that uses entropy).
Model score is 0.9 (evaluated on test set).
Before training, input data and data correlation have been plotted, dataset normalized (for a better GD performance) and divided into training and test sets.
